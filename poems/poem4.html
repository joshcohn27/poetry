        <h1>Abrasive Freedom</h1>
        <pre class="poem">
            My heart has been ripped from my chest, my life changed,
            emotions hidden like tears in the rain.
            Trying to navigate my new life, seeking for my best self.
            But this is actually the happiest I've been here,
            the most friends I've had, the freest I've lived.
            So it was never meant to be. It was never right.
            I shouldn't be tied down here,
            nor should I restrain myself, as the benefits of being free…
            They heavily outweigh the cons.
            I do things just for me, to make me laugh,
            to make me smile, to bring me joy.
            As I am only as great as I allow myself to be,
            as I grow more and more,
            I sew my heart back into my chest.
