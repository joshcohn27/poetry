        <h1>The Cost of Silence</h1>
        <pre class="poem">
I feel guilty
Sitting in silence
Making my impacts behind the scenes
Small and unseen

Hidden because my friends can't know
My family can't know
My bosses can't know
Exactly how I feel

Or I'll be cast out from my community
Bridges burned with friends
Employment on the line
Alone, depressed

And in that case
No impacts will be made
No one benefiting from my existence
So I would not exist

But speaking up
Could inspire others to follow
To spark real change
To better the world

So what the fuck do I do?
Stay quiet
Complacent in injustice
Unable to live with myself

Or speak out
Lose the life I know
Live with myself
Praying at least one person is inspired
