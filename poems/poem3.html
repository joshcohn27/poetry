        <pre class="poem">
            Driving down the highway, blasting the music
            The kind that makes you cry
            The only way I can reliably feel emotion
            While the pills hold back like a dam
            
            It's kinda hard to cry
            Time and place are crucial
            These pills fucking suck, damn
            As I am struggling to feel.
            
            There's no time, no place more crucial
            Than in the state I'm in
            Struggling to get a feel
            On where to go next
            
            What state am I actually in?
            Although I'm lost, I know where I am
            Where am I going to go next?
            The blasting music on the highway will guide.
