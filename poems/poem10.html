        <pre class="poem">
today was a rough day
but today was not a failure

i got overwhelmed
overworked
and overstimulated

but instead of crashing out
or even spiraling
i practiced mindfulness
to get me through the rough patches

i did breathing exercises
to calm me down
i vented to my colleagues
who could help fix
what was causing some of my problems

i kept my composure
in front of everyone else
i was respectful
even when annoyed
i was calm
when getting yelled at

i was finally able
to see the joy
that's in my life right now
all it took
was for it to briefly pause

i'm almost forcing myself
to feel lonely
when in reality
it's ignorant to feel that way

loneliness is not defined
by lack of a significant other
or lack of a sexual partner

but instead
by not having love
and support
around you

and i'm so lucky
to have so much of both
not only here
but everywhere
whether it feels like it or not

other people love me
other people care about me
other people are joyful
when i'm around

and i love those people
i care for each of them
they make me so happy
and they don't understand
the positive impact
they have on me
and my life

i'm growing
and learning
constantly

i love who i am
and i love how happy i feel
surrounded by these people
and i think i'm finally realizing

these people are happy
because i'm around
their faces light up
when they lay eyes on me
grins spanning ear to ear
just because i walked in
i have the power to do that
because i'm genuinely myself

even with people i'm meeting
for the first time
or that i've only been close with
for not very long

so i'm going to keep being me
i'm going to keep learning
i'm going to keep growing
i'm going to keep smiling
because i am me
