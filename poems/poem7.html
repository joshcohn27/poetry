        <h1>More than an Impression</h1>
        <pre class="poem">
I know what I want
I can't find what I need
someone who loves me
who cherishes me
appreciates me
accepts me for who I am

they glance and move on
eyes skim the surface
but never stay long enough
to see the fire underneath
I'm not polished
not pretty in that way
I won't stop you in your tracks

but give me time
and I will show you
a mind that glows in the dark
a heart that never quits
a soul you won't forget
caring you've never felt in your existence

still, no one slows down
no one dares to look deeper
how can they know what's there
if I never get a chance
to be more than a first impression
