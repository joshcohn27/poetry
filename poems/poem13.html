        <h1>Once in a Lifetime</h1>
        <pre class="poem">
holding on, I refuse to release
what once was mine
searching constantly in every person
why am I wasting my time?

I'm looking twice for a once in a lifetime
to recreate my past
with someone new and different
but that just never lasts

in every ship I search for her
what we lived and knew
something that felt irreplaceable
so why would I want something new?

I refuse to let go of her
the time that we enjoyed
it's impossible to get over you
but with nothing to fill the void

I overwrite good memories
with stories of fake hate
maybe that will make it easier
to move on from something great

but that's destructive
dangerous
disrespectful
disingenuous

life is hard and stressful
positives can be rare
so intentionally losing the memory
is something I shouldn't bear

once in a lifetime is that
something you can't recreate
I can look back on positives
without letting them dictate

how I am doing today
it isn't lost in history
as I look forward to finding
my next once in a lifetime memory
