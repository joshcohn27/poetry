I love your personality
in fact, it's all I know of you
your name, your school
your likes and dislikes
I feel like I know you

but I've never met you
I've never seen you
the color of your hair
the way you smile
the sound of your voice
are all a mystery

and yet, I don't care
I get happy when I talk to you
sad when I don't hear from you
I sit from afar and watch you struggle
struggle to make it through each day

I want to help you
I need to
I need you to be happy
because you've brought so many smiles to my face
so many laughs to my days
so much joy you'll never know existed
