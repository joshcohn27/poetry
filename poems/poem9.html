"Be grateful for what you have"
The words repeat endlessly in my brain
Used to guilt myself into feeling bad for feeling bad
Diminishing my struggles

Why is this the norm?
Why is this okay?
Why has society told me I need to feel this way?
Why are my struggles compared to that of others?

If a puzzle was built wrong,
would you tell the solver
to be glad they have a few pieces at all?

no.
you'd sit beside them,
you'd share their pain,
you'd search for another way
to complete the picture.

"Well at least you have a roof over your '"
What if there's screaming and crying under the roof?
What if there's pain and anxiety under the roof?
What if there's an abusive parent under the roof?
Would it be better to not have a roof at all?

Do I need to earn the right to hurt?
Suffering doesn't have a scoreboard.
I don't want your permission to feel what I feel

I want to scream
To cry
To not be okay
Without being told someone has it worse
