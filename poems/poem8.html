        <h1>Just a Dream</h1>
        <pre class="poem">
It was just a dream
Drowning in a cold pool of sweat
Trying to decipher reality 
I know it wasn't real, and yet

I'm still off balance
Emotions back unchecked
Maybe I should just swim down
To escape the need to dissect

It was just a dream
But do I want it to be reality?
Holding out hope for something extinct 
I can't let it go even though I'm free

I think I have support
Though it's easy to ignore
Forced loneliness feels better
It's something to cry for

It was just a dream
But it lingers throughout the day
I live pretending like nothing happened
But I am not okay 

I still don't know how to manage
While my mind follows this theme
I'm hoping for a sign
That it was just a dream
