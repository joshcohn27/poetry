        <pre class="poem">
“It's good to ask for help”
A sign I walk past every day
Intended as a beacon of hope for some
Comes across as a giant middle finger to all

What happens if I ask?
I'm told I'm only allotted a slim amount of “help”
I'm shown time and time again
the only part of me that's valued is my tuition check
I'm given pity instead of support
I'm shut out from sharing my opinions
I'm judged by others for being “weird”
I'm set up to fail

Attending a school that strives to be a big corporation
They want to be evil
They want to cut corners
They want to be as cheap as possible
They want their students to suffer

And at the end what do I get?
A piece of paper?
They smile at me like it's valuable
But it doesn't even know my name
It doesn't remember the nights I couldn't sleep
The many panic attacks I had in the bathroom
The help I never received
The brain they drained and destroyed
just to toss aside to make money
