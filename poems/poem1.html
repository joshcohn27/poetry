        <pre class="poem">
I am the one who will speak up
when others are quiet.
I am the ball of energy
when it's time to riot.

I am the one who will make jokes
when others are depressed.
I will make my peers happier
when in hard times of stress.

I am the one who will help <i>you</i>
when <i>you</i> have nobody.
I will always be there for <i>you</i>
when <i>you</i> have nobody.

But who is there for me?
<i>I</i> am my own worst nightmare,
my biggest bully, my least favorite person,
my greatest stressor, my worst nightmare.

I put <i>you</i> first because that's how I'm wired.
I am always the last person I think of.
Some call this selfless, generous, or caring,
but in reality, it's just self-hate.

So I am the one who fools <i>you</i>
when <i>you</i> fall for my lies.
Because I will keep deceiving
until <i>you</i> free your eyes.
