        <h1>Morality</h1>
        <pre class="poem">
You share your opinions
And fight for what's right
You'll do what it takes
To win the long fight

Your morals stand
Like unmovable stone
Guiding you forward
Even when alone

You will never know
The impact you left on me
Before, I was hidden and peeking
Like sunlight through the trees

You taught me what good looks like
And the evils that hide in plain sight
Now every choice I make
Is because I believe it's right

You pushed me to speak up
When silence felt safer
You showed me that caring
Is truly a lifesaver

And though you'll never know
The depth of your impact
I carry it forward each day
My morals finally intact
