        <pre class="poem">
            Where am I going?
            Wandering lonely through the night
            Am I safe on this 737 Max 9 by Boeing?
            
            We enter the sky, pressure flowing
            I really hope this was built right
            Where am I going?
            
            The aggressive winds blowing
            Even the crew looked nervous on this flight
            Am I safe on this 737 Max 9 by Boeing?
            
            The anxiety in my chest is growing
            Am I going to be alright
            Where am I going?
            
            Uh oh. It's snowing
            My eyes filled with fear and fright
            Am I safe on this 737 Max 9 by Boeing?
            
            I can see the stars glowing
            My hands are holding the armrest tight.
            Where am I going?
            Am I safe on this 737 Max 9 by Boeing?
